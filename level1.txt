It is a cold Monday morning. The rain beats heavily against the window, turning everything grey and miserable.
You stand by your desk, Windows 11 is chunterring to itself (as it does) and you know it will be at least 15 minutes
before its ready to be used.

Now you know why SSDs where invented, if only you had one installed!

The cheap metal table wobbles slightly under the vigour in which Windows 11 is mercilessly hammering the harddrive
simply because you switched on the computer.

Romours of a new version of Windows coming, soon usual promises, higher specd machine required to use the same version
of Office as the last one...

The bland magnolia walls of the office and the solitary strip light give an almost film noir feeling to the room.
Another huge pile of Windows issues awaits you today, more joys with printers Windows forgets exist, domain networks
suddenly becoming Public for no reason, shared network drives siddnely having incorrect credentials despite them being
correct...



There is a door to your west, and another to the south

The room is small and dimly lit. There are shelves with computers on, and a rack of software.
 
Wow! You say out loud as you see a copy of Windows XP upgrade brand new and boxed. Those were the old days, networking
was easy and reliable, network shares didn't suddenly not work, mind you Internet Explorer was obsessed with giving  
the computer viruses..

There are all sorts of odd-bod software on the shelf, even Windows 3.11 for workgroups original floppies!

You find yousrself in a brightly lit corridor. The walls are dull magnolia and the carpet a happy beige, the corridor  
is empty, it seems to stretch into infinity. 
 
The beigeness of it all seems strangely unsettling, there is a light humming noise like the sound inside a server room
there seemed to be a barely noticeable flicker to the ceiling lights.

You find yousrself deeper in the brightly lit corridor.   
The corridor is empty, it seems to stretch into infinity. 
 
The beigeness of it all seems strangely unsettling, there is a light humming noise like the sound inside a server room
there seemed to be a barely noticeable flicker to the ceiling lights.   
 
Looking at the walls of corridor show a strange newness and blandness to the walls...

You find yourself in a small room with and a desk with a lamp on it with a typewriter! 

There is also a small window

The walls are bare, the same blandess from the corridor seemed to somehow infect this small room.   
Seems odd that no one is about, for a Monday that is weird, the window allows the dim sun light to come in from outside 
the faint hammering of the rain against the window acts like Musak giving a theme tune to your experience

You find yourself in an even smaller room.  

In the corner of the room is an old beige server, it has an old 15 inch monitor on it. The monitor is on proudly
displaying the words: NT4 Server SP6a

In the front of the server a DDS tape drive is whirring away to itself, the server has an old DIN connected Cherry
keyboard - no expense spared!
  
Above the server is a small rack with an Allied Telesyn 24 port hub flashing away.

The room is much bigger with two large desks with computers on it 

You notice the first computer is on and the screen proudly displays a screensaver with Windows ME emblazened on it
 
The second computer is also on and that displays a screen with: Windows Vista on it
 
The Vista computer is chunterring to itself much like your Windows 11 computer, how far we have come!
  
In the room the temperature does seem noticeable higher than normal, or was that just an illusion?

The lights in the room seem dimmer than the previous  

There is a small desk with a lamp it, the lamp is on and pointing to the keyboard on the desk

It is illuminating the letters IBM, the computer desktop is stained beige, you see the words SX-33 on the case, in a 
nice comforting blue

The screen is a beige 15 inch CRT (old skool!) on which it is a loading screen with: Windows 95 on it, a quick look
suggests it has crashed on loading, the room seems quite warm..

The room is darker than the previous  

There is a lonely looking old desk against one wall, there is a small window above it, which seems blocked
 
The desk has a computer on it with a very noisy fan, the tiny 14 inch monitor which boasts the words: EGA on it has a
screen on it that displays:

    C:\VER 
 
    MS-DOS Version 3.30
   
    C:\

On the disk is a huge pile disks proudly labelled: Windows 3.11 for Workgroups, does seem awfully hot in here..

The room is dark and hot, the light flicker strangely, there is an old oak table with a very old looking computer on it

A 14 inch CRT green screen monitor, the screen is a bit fuzzy and has a strange bar that loops around the display.
 
On the display you can just about read:

The room is large and brightly lit, the temperature is incredibly hot, you stagger into the room as the heat hits you  

You see a huge desk at one end of the room with a massive 30 inch monitor which proudly displays a message:   
 
   Windows 12 is here!
    

      Upgrade now - or die!
 
      (ALL updates especially destructive updates are mandatory) 
   
 
You hear a loud cackling behind you, spinning round you see Bill Gates grinning menacingly at you.

Time to upgrade BOY! He shouts at you, he grabs your arm with impossible strength, the heat and brightness of the room
is draining your will to resist. A drill sounds somewhere near, with your vision blurring (it is sooooo hot!) you just
about see Gates other arm swing a drill at your left temple

Need to fit a USB port Gates shouts with glee, you feel faint and lose consciousness...when you awake the room is now 
empty and over your vision is super-imposed: Windows 12 update installing please wait...   THE END

You find yousrself even deeper in the brightly lit corridor.   
The corridor is empty, it seems to stretch into infinity just lie before. 
 
The beigeness of it all seems strangely unsettling, there is a light humming noise like the sound inside a server room
there seemed to be a barely noticeable flicker to the ceiling lights.   
 
Looking at the walls of corridor show a strange newness and blandness to the walls...    

Who designed this?

The corridor bends to the right, in the corner is a water dispenser with goldfish in it!  

There is a picture of Bill Gates on the wall holding a box with the words Windows 98SE on it, he seems happy..
 
On the floor is a single floppy disk, it has a label and on it is writen in large text:
 
  WINDOWS 2.0 PLUS GEM

In the corridor is a small desk with flyers on it 

Old adverts for Windows 1.0 and DOS as well as a barely visible flyer with: OS/2 Warp written on it
 
Strange there is no one here, wonder where all the employees are?

The room is small and well lit, there is a small desk against the one wall, it has a small white-ish computer on it  
you peer round to see the screen, the monitor has: Apple on it, the screen is displaying a program: Paint
  
This room has lots of pictures on the wall, all with various old computers on them, there is a musty smell to the 
room and it reminds you of libraries
 
Seems cooler in here than the other rooms, you notice a wastepaper basket in the corner, in it is a magazine, you can
just about read the title: Linux Today

The room is large, with many desks on it, all with the monitors covered in a beige shroud 

A loud hum fills the room, against one wall is a huge rack of rack mounted servers, next to it is a smaller rack with
racks of CDs on it

You notice that none of the CDs are labelled, what is on them? What is on those servers? Why isn't the room air cooled 
with air conditioning?
  
Many questions fill your head, but where to find the answers?

This corridor never seems to end! Oh the blandness of it all...seems to drain the soul (bit like Windows updates)  

The magnolia walls seem to blend seamlessly into each other, almost as though it is some sort of rats maze where the  
maze goes round in circles endlessly....

You see a blue arrow on the wall pointing north

The corridor seems brighter, no less draining and dreary..  

A voice sounds over some invisible public address system:  
 
   Loyal employess, rejoice as Windows 12 is here!
   Please upgrade now...devops special systems, CEO and longhorn supporters exempt
  
   Switch on, upgrade, update, update update!

You enter a small room (sounds familiar), the beige carpet looks new there is a small desk in the corner with an award  
on it:
  
 
   Microsoft Award Continuing For Lack Of Development
 
   1998 - 2024
  
   Goes To:

   Windows Internet Security, Not Gone, Never Implemented

Seems a lot cooler in the corridor now, lights seem brighter, strange combination.. 

The wall has a huge poster onto which is written in huge letters: XBOX 360  
 
Wow! You think, that takes me back, at least it did not suffer from the red light of death like the PS3, maybe it is 
possible for Microsoft to make something that actually works and heck is even reliable?

You enter a small room, the lights are dim but you can see a small desk dimly lit with a failing lamp  

On the desk you can see an old Xbox 360 controller, an 80 pin SCSI drive and small notepad, with some writing on it,  
you lean forward and just about read the words: 

  Q: How many Microsoft engineers does it take to change a lightbulb?

  A; NONE, they make darkness the industry standard 
 

You see an old Commodore 64 in the corner, looking at the old machines reminds you of how it was instrumental in having   
an interest in programming develop inside you, and how many happy hours your waited for tape games to load.. 

Plus the joy of 6510 machine code, your mind is filled with an old image:

   LDA #0
   STA $D020
   RTS

There is a lively air to the room, the room is filled with racks of awards, you look at them, strangely the awards have  
have white labels over any writing, why?
  
Each corner of the room has a small table with a lamp on it, the lamps are on and the desks all have computers on them 
the screens are off and a white tape with bright red writing is wrapped around each computer
 
The tape says: TOP SECRET
  
On the floor is a book (why is it on the floor?) the front of the book says: 

   The Road Ahead
 
     Bill Gates

The room is large and at the one end is a huge open patio door, you see a long desk along on wall, it is full of books
and disks

All the books and disks have the same word on them: LINUX

Linux! You shout of course! No more chunterring, no more having the domain network randomly change to public so all
network shares fail, no more piles of driver disks

Wow! The Linux printer driver offers a HUGE range of options the Windows does not, you get giddy with the excitement of
it all

Windows, you remember needs insane system requirements just to run the SAME version of Office on your previous version
of Windows, no more sudden slow downs, dodgy updates, mandatory updates... 

Farewell poor Service Packs we knew them well and how we miss them!

That is it, you shout, Linux could not only save increase our workload and massively increase efficiency, but could alos
usher in a new era of world peace!

Without a pause you grab as many Linux CDs as you can and flee out of the patio doors - THE END
